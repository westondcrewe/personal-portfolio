# Weston Crewe — Developer Portfolio

[![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Site-Vercel-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel)](https://westoncrewe-portfolio.vercel.app/)

A personal, modular portfolio website built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to showcase my work, projects, and personality in a clean, responsive layout.

This site is my central hub — part résumé, part portfolio, part playground — and serves as a live example of my frontend development skills. I plan to continue working on this portfolio, as it is only MVP status right now. My next additions/improvements will include:
- Additional projects
- More dynamic and interactive UI design

---

## Features

- **Modular component architecture** — Easily add, remove, or reorder portfolio sections without breaking the layout
- **State management** - Relies on React hooks for component state management (project card components expand the skills tags while user hovers over a specific project)
- **Responsive design** — Built with Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Optimized images** — Uses `next/image` for fast loading and responsive sizing

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) — React framework for fast, server-rendered and statically-generated sites
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — Utility-first CSS for rapid UI building

**Deployment**
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) — Easy hosting and CI/CD for Next.js

---

## Sections

- **Hero Section** — Page intro with headline, bio, photos, and interests
- **Project Showcase** — Highlights select projects with hyperlinks, descriptions, and images
- **Technical Skills** - Lists technical skills attributed in my projects data, listing specific projects in which particular skill is used
- **Call To Action** — Invitation for viewers to contact me via LinkedIn and Email, download my resume, and to collaborate on my active GitHub projects
