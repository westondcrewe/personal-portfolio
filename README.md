# Weston Crewe â€” Developer Portfolio

[![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Site-Vercel-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel)](https://westoncrewe-portfolio.vercel.app/)

A personal, modular portfolio website built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to showcase my work, projects, and personality in a clean, responsive layout.

This site is my central hub â€” part rÃ©sumÃ©, part portfolio, part playground â€” and serves as a live example of my frontend development skills. I plan to continue working on this portfolio, as it is only MVP status right now. My next additions/improvements will include:
- Additional projects
- More dynamic and interactive UI design

## Features

- **Modular component architecture** â€” Easily add, remove, or reorder portfolio sections without breaking the layout
- **Responsive design** â€” Built with Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Optimized images** â€” Uses `next/image` for fast loading and responsive sizing
- **Call-to-action sections** â€” Invite collaboration, showcase active projects, and provide quick links to my rÃ©sumÃ© and LinkedIn
- **Project highlights** â€” Links to active GitHub repositories for ongoing work

---

## Tech Stack
