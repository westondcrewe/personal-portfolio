# Weston Crewe — Developer Portfolio

[![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Site-Vercel-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel)](https://westoncrewe-portfolio.vercel.app/)

A personal, modular portfolio website built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to showcase my work, projects, and personality in a clean, responsive layout.

This site is my central hub — part résumé, part portfolio, part playground — and serves as a live example of my frontend development skills.
